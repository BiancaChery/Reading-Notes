This topic pertains what we are learning, because it teaches us how to identify and correct our errors in the coding program. 

**What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript.

Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error. -Syntax errors are the spelling errors in code that either stop the program from running altogther or stops it at a certain point of the code. Logic errors are the errors where the syntax is correct but the code runs incorrectly, meaning the program will run successfully but give incorrect results.

List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them. -I have come across syntax errors and logic errors as well. It was because I would put something in code in capital letters when it should be lower case, I would change it and put the correct info and it would run. With logic, it was because I had a certain part of code after or before some code that needed to be ran first in my program.

How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals? This topic helps me to understand when I have syntax and logic errors, where to notice I've gone wrong in my code, what to look for when it comes to fixing it, and also making sure to put the correct coding in to have my program run smoothly.


**The JavaScript Debugger.

How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development? The JavaScript Debugger tool, or the dev tools for short, is the shortcut on a website to understand what errors are showing in the code that you've created for your program. It works like a magnifying glass on the exact problem area that needs correction, it allows you to click on one specific piece of tect and see in the console where the error occurs and then from there you could fix it. 

Define what a breakpoint is. -The breakpoint is simply a pause of execution in code that you want to stop from running in run time on the program, it allows you to identify the problems in your code that prevent it from running properly.

What is the call stack? The call stack is the section that shows what code was executed to get to the current line of code.
