## nosql vs sql

Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:
SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases(RDBMS), NoSQL databases are primarily called as non-relational distributed database.
SQL databases are table based, NoSQL databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores.
SQL databases have predefined schema, NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data.
SQL databases are vertically scalable, NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.  
 	 
What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database? -Highly structured and associations among the program entites are clearly defined.  

Give a real world example. -Platforms, such as Snapchat and Instagram, make use of SQL to store the profile information of users. 

What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database? -Semi-structured and unstructured data. 

Give a real world example. -Netflix uses a NoSQL database to store and manage massive amounts of data including customer profiles, viewing histories, and content recommendations.

Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage? -The type of database that is best is the NoSQL database.

Which type of database is best for scalability? -A NoSQL database is best for scalability, as they can be scaled both vertically and horizontally.

How does it work? -There are databases in the NoSQL, like a shop database. There are so-called collections as opposed to tables, and inside them are documents that do not have to use the same schema. 

What is inside of a MongoDB database? -Collections of data, that hold one or more BSON documents. 

Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why. -MongoDB is more flexible as it doesn't have such constraints. 

What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database? -They don't support atomicity, consistency, isolation and durability transactions across multiple documents.
