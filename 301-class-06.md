## How I explained REST to my brother

Who is Roy Fielding? -Is a guy who helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet. 

Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use in this class work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world? -They would only connect to one set thing, the 'http' allows you to find a location of something anywhere in the world from anywhere in the world. 

What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created? -It's all about applying verbs to nouns. For instance, when you're on a web page, the browser does an 'HTTP GET' on the url you typed in and back comes a web page.

What does a GET do? -Allows you to pick something up or pick that item.

What does a POST do? -Adds something to another system from one system.

What does PUT do? -Replaces something in a system from another system. 

What does PATCH do? -Does a partial update on a system.
