# Status Codes Based On REST Methods

In your own words, describe what each group of status code represents:
100’s = These are informational status codes; they send a message to the client that the first part of a request is received. 
200’s = These are the success codes. These let the client know that the request was accepted. 
300’s = These are the redirection codes. These tell the client that the resource isn't available at the expected location anymore. 
400’s = These are the client error codes. These are when the client sends an invalid request to a server.
500’s = These are the server error codes. They can be temporary or permanent, and often indicate problems with an overwhelmed server.

What is a status code 202? -A status 202 code tells the client that the request was valid, but the processing of it happens later. 

What is a status code 308? -A permanent redirect that tells the client to use another URL to access the resource instead of the current one. 

What code would you use if an update didn’t return data to a client? -A 204 No Content code.

What code would you use if a resource used to exist but no longer does? - A 410 Gone code. 

What is the ‘Forbidden’ status code? -In this code, the client has authorized itself to the backend yet and the server may give it access after it has happened.

## Build A REST API With Node.js, Express, & MongoDB - Quick - First 20 minutes

Why do we need to pull our MongoDB database string out of our server and put it into our .env? -It's for the security in the coding.

What is middleware? -A layer of software components between different parts of a system. They facilitate communication, processing and interactions. 

What does app.use(express.json()) do? -It parses the JSON data, stores it in a `req.body` property, then passes control to the next middleware in the appropriate route handler.

What does the /:id mean in a route? -It indicates that a part of the uRL is a placeholder for a value. 

What is the difference between PUT and PATCH? -The PUT method is used to update an entire resource or replace it. The PATCH method is used to apply partial updates to a resource. 

How do you make a default value in a schema? -By using mongoose and set the property within the field's definition in the schema.

What does a 500 error status code mean? -It's a catch-all error message that doesn't give specifics on what went wrong. 

What is the difference between a status 200 and a status 201? -A status 200 code indicates that the client's request was successful, and the server has successfully processed the request. A status 201 code indicates that the request was successful, and a new resource has been created.
