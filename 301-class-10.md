## Understanding the JavaScript Call Stack

What is a ‘call’? -It is a function invocation.

How many ‘calls’ can happen at once? -One at a time, from top to bottom. 

What does LIFO mean? -Last In, First Out

Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack. 
-function firstFunction(){
  throw new Error('Stack Trace Error');
}
function secondFunction(){
  firstFunction();
}
function thirdFunction(){
  secondFunction();
}
thirdFunction();

What causes a Stack Overflow? -A recursive function without an exit point.
