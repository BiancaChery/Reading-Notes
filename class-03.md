**Learn HTML: Ordered & Unordered Lists

When should you use an unordered list in your HTML document? When presenting a grouping of items that are not in any set order.

How do you change the bullet style of unordered list items? By using the 'list-style-type' method in the CSS element. 

When should you use an ordered list vs an unorder list in your HTML document? You should use an ordered list when the order is meaningful, like a recipe or directions to a location. An unordered list just nests thing together in a list, like random items needed for a trip. 

Describe two ways you can change the numbers on list items provided by an ordered list? The first way you can change numbers is by using the letters (I,i) to present the text as roman numerals. The second is just using the numbers (1,2,3,etc) as it is default.

**Learn CSS: The Box Model

Describe the CSS properties of margin and padding as characters in a story. What is their role in a story titled: “The Box Model”? Margin would be represented as the big brother of someone (the oldest, so the protector, covers every sibling). Padding would be represented as the last to youngest sibling (old enough to cover and protect the youngest, but still has protection around them). As pertaining to the text, margin would represent the wider aspect of the whole box itself. Padding is the space surrounding the content of the box.

List and describe the four parts of an HTML elements box as referred to by the box model. The Content box: is the area where the content is displayed. The Padding Box: is the white space surrounding the content. The Border box: is the spacing around the padding and content. And the Margin box: is the outermost layer, it wraps up all three elements (content, padding and the border) and is the whitespace between the box and other elements.


**Learn JS: Arrays. Operators and Expressions. Conditionals. Loops.

What data types can you store inside of an Array? Arrays can store numbers, strings, boolean values (true and false), characters and objects.

Is the people array a valid JavaScript array? If so, how can I access the values stored? If not, why? I'm honestly not sure, I don't understand the coding below it. 

List five shorthand operators for assignment in javascript and describe what they do. 
BigInt operators are operators that can be used as values.
String operators can be used to concatenate two string values together.
Conditional (ternary) operator is the only JavaSCript that requires three operands, it has one or two values based on a condition.
Comma operator evaluates both of its operands and returns the value of the last one.

Read the code below and evaluate the last expression and explain what the result would be and why.


Describe a real world example of when a conditional statement should be used in a JavaScript program. When trying to find out someone's status such as age to determine if they are a minor or an adult.

Give an example of when a Loop is useful in JavaScript. A loop is useful in JavaScript when the script presents T/F conditions, it will continue running until the defined condition returns false.
