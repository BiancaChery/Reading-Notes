***Ordered & Unordered Lists

When should you use an unordered list in your HTML document? When presenting a grouping of items that are not in any set order.

How do you change the bullet style of unordered list items? By using the 'list-style-type' method in the CSS element. 

When should you use an ordered list vs an unorder list in your HTML document? You should use an ordered list when the order is meaningful, like a recipe or directions to a location. An unordered list just nests thing together in a list, like random items needed for a trip. 

Describe two ways you can change the numbers on list items provided by an ordered list? The first way you can change numbers is by using the letters (I,i) to present the text as roman numerals. The second is just using the numbers (1,2,3,etc) as it is default.

***The Box Model

Describe the CSS properties of margin and padding as characters in a story. What is their role in a story titled: “The Box Model”? Margin would be represented as the big brother of someone (the oldest, so the protector, covers every sibling). Padding would be represented as the last to youngest sibling (old enough to cover and protect the youngest, but still has protection around them). As pertaining to the text, margin would represent the wider aspect of the whole box itself. Padding is the space surrounding the content of the box.

List and describe the four parts of an HTML elements box as referred to by the box model.
