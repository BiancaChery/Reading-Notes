These topics of reading pertain to what we are studying in the module, because we are learning how to structure an HTML into a web form. We learned how an event takes place within HTML, and what happens after a certain event is created, the effect after that event being done.

**HTML Forms: Your first Web Form. How To Structure A Web Form.

Why are forms so important in web development? -They are used for collecting data from users, or allowing them to control a user interface.

When designing a form, what are some key things to keep in mind when it comes to user experience? -Label fields clearly and concisely. Address users' concerns in the place they will arise. Use descriptive, action-based words on buttons. Consider using the first-person on buttons. Don't use placeholder text as labels. Don't use all-uppercase in labels or placeholder text.

List 5 form elements and explain their importance. 
-The option element, defines an option that can be selected. 
-The label element, defines a label for several form elements.
-The select element, defines a drop down list.
-The textarea element, defines a multi-line input field (where you can input text).
-The button element, defines a clickable button to the web page.

**Learn JS: Introduction To Events.

How would you describe events to a non-technical friend? -I would describe it like cause and effect, there is something that happens that will have an effect to it. Like applying an email to a newsletter, once the email is submitted you receive information to that email afterwards.

When using the addEventListener() method, what 2 arguments will you need to provide? -Two arguments we will need to provide is a string to indicate that we want to listen for the event, and then a function to call when the event happens.

Describe the event object. Why is the target within the event object useful? -an event object is usually a parameter with a name of "event, evt, or e", and can automatically passed to event handlers to provide extra features and information. The target in the event is useful because it is used to target just the event and not the whole page itself.

What is the difference between event bubbling and event capturing? -Event bubbling is the description of how the browser handles events that are targeted at nested elements. Event capturing is the same just the order is reversed. so instead of the event acting first, it starts with the least fired and works its way through the elemnts until the target is reached.
