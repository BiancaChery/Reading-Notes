As we are introduced to the new topics of JavaScript, it is relating to us needing it because it is another element to coding. We are learning it for object placing and how to construct them all into an array. 

**Domain Modeling

Explain why we need domain modeling. -Domain modeling is needed because it is the process of creating a concept model in coding for a specific problem.

**HTML Table Basics

Why should tables not be used for page layouts? Tables are only used for tabular data, they are designed for that especially. Whenever it is used in the page layout, it makes it less accessible to the reader, they produce a term called tag soup, which can result in the code being harder to write, maintain and debug.
 
List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML <table>. 
  -The th element (table header), it denotes a header to the table you're creating.
  -The colspan element, which makes a variable span across two column cells of the table and
  -The rowspan element, which makes a variable span across two row cells in the table
  
**Introducing Constructors

What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it? A constructor is a function that uses the new keyword. It creates a new object, binds 'this' to the new project so you can access it in the new constructor code, it can run it in that constructor code and also it will return the new object.
  
How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor? An object literal requires it to be written numerous times as opposed to constructor where it can be grouped into the object and be returned to give more than one response.
  
**Object Prototypes Using A Constructor

Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience. -I'm not so sure how to put that into an analogy based off my last work experience.
