## React Docs - Thinking in React

What is the single responsibility principle and how does it apply to components? -A computer programming principle that states that "a module should be responsible to one, and only one. It's set for the component to ideally only do one thing, and if it grows, it should be decomposed into smaller subcomponents.

What does it mean to build a ‘static’ version of your application? -The 'static' version is a UI built from the data model, it's like a mock model without the interactivity added. 

Once you have a static application, what do you need to add? -You would need to add components that reuse other components and pass data using props. 

What are the three questions you can ask to determine if something is state? -"Does it remain unchanged over time?", "Is it passed in from a parent via props?", and "Can you compute it based on existing state or props in your component?"

How can you identify where state needs to live? -You identify every component that renders something based on that state. Often, you can put the state directly into their common parent. If you can't find a component where it makes sense to won the state, you just create a new component solely for holding the state and adding it in the hierarchy above the common parent component.

## Higher-Order Functions

What is a “higher-order function”? -Functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them.

Explore the greaterThan function as defined in the reading. In your own words, what is line 2 of this function doing? -In the function, the second line shows what would be returned after invoking the function in code. 

Explain how either map or reduce operates, with regards to higher-order functions. -The map method transforms an array by applying a function to all of its elements and building a new array from the returned values. Reduce builds a value by repeatedly taking a single element from the array and combining it with the current value.
