These topics are pertinent to understanding and coding in HTML documents using JavaScript. We need them to understand the different elements are variables into making text.

**Learn HTML: Creating Hyperlinks

To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element? You would wrap the text or content in an <a> element.

The href attribute contains what information? The href attribute contains the web address of the HTML file.

What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers? To make it accessible to all readers, you must use a clear link wording.

**CSS Layout: CSS Layout: Normal Flow CSS Layout: Positioning

What is meant by “normal flow”? It ensures that the page is readable, even with a limited browser or a device like a screen reader that reads the info on the page out to the user.
 
What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements? Block-level elements consume the entire width of the text, they always start in a new line and have top and bottom margins, with no other elements around them. Block-level elements are elements like: "<h1>, <li>, <ol>, the <p> tags and etc...". Where as inline elements are the tags used to add content into the webpage, they can be used along side other elements and they do not have top or bottom margins. Inline elements are elements like: "<a>, <script>, <span> and <img>", just to name a few. They are the same in the sense in which they provide the content with information to the webpage being made. 

___ positioning is the default for every html element. -Static positioning

Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element. 
  -It allows developers to control the precise position of elements on a webpage
  -it allows elements to be positioned independently of their parent elements, which makes it easier to create complex layouts and not conflict with other elements

What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning? The key difference between absolute and fixed positioning is absolute fixes the element in place independently to its parent element, fixed would typically fix the element in place with a visible portion of the viewport.

**Learn JS: Functions – Reusable Blocks of Code

Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation. -A function declaration declares the making of variables and functions. A function invocation is the coding used in place to run the info that was declared. 

What is the difference between a parameter and an argument? Function parameters are the names listed in the function's definition or the function declaration. An arguments are the values passed to the function. 

**6 Reasons For Pair Programming

Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.
  -Learning from my classmates and work environment readiness I feel would benefit because your classmates have different outlooks on the info being given and could explain it to me on a different level that makes sense to me. The work environment readiness woudl prepare me to be comfortable doing coding for the first time in a office environment. I get to learn how to work together to come up with coding and placing my syntax correctly.
