https://web.dev/learn/css/flexbox/

Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means. -The one-dimensional element of the flexbox, is a layout in which you position items on individual rows or coulumns without respect to the next rows or columns.

Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis. -The main axis is the axis that runs across the row page or down the column page, based off the flex direction. The cross axis is the axis that is perpendicular to the main axis, it would potentially run in the direction downward from the main axis.

How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility? It can affect the performance issues, and increase the page loading time if you have a larger project running.

It connects as in the future, with working in the field of software development, there will instances where these types of elements would need to be used. It is connected because in order to properly use it in code through the work place, I have to understand and grasp the knowledge of what flexboxs are and what they are used for.
