How The Web Works
How the web works is by providing a simplified view of what is happening when viewing a web page in a web browser.
Clients are the web user's internet connected devices and web-accessing software available on the devices.
Servers are computers that store webpages and etc

Internet Connection: Allows you to send and receive data on the web
TCP/IP: Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol are communication protocols that define how data should travel across the internet.
DNS: Domain Name System is like an address book for websites.
HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol is an application protocol that defines a language for clients and servers to speak to each other.
Component Files: a website made up of different files, the files come in two main types, Code Files and Assets
                 Code Files: websites built primarily from HTML, CSS, and Javascript
                 Assets:a collective name for all the other stuff that make up a website (images, music, video, Word documents, and PDF's)
                 
"Ever been sitting at home
wondering how could I get that item from the store?
You look down the road and see it peeking back at you
your feet can move you down to get there too.
You make your way out down the road, sending signals to the ground
are you sure you'll make it around?
You see it plain and clear
and as you come up around you notice the rear.
You stop and now its right in your face
that's how HTTP shows up to run the place.
You have made it to the webpage"

HTML, CSS, and JS files are "parsed" in the browser, starting with the HTML file first. As the browser parses the HTML, 
it sends info back to the server for any CSS files found from the <link> elements, and any JavaScript files found from the <script> elements. 
From those, the browser parses CSS and JavaScript. The browser generates an in-memory DOM tree from the parsed HTML, then generates CSSOM structure from
the parsed CSS, and compiles and executes the parsed JS. As the browser builds the DOM and applies the styles from CSSOM, it executes the JS, and a visual 
representation of the page is now on the screen, the user can now interact with it.
  
You find images to add to a website by going to google images and searching for something suitable. Once you find the image you want, click on it to enlarge it. 
Right click the image (Ctrl + click), choose Save Image As and choose the folder to save it in. You can also copy the image's web address 
from the browser address bar.

In JavaScript, a String is created by enclosing it in a single or double quote mark. A Number is created without quotes around them.

Variables are containers that store values. They are necessary to do anything interesting in programming, such as personalie a greeting message, or change an 
image displayed in an image gallery.
