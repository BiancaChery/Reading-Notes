How The Web Works
How the web works is by providing a simplified view of what is happening when viewing a web page in a web browser.
Clients are the web user's internet connected devices and web-accessing software available on the devices.
Servers are computers that store webpages and etc

Internet Connection: Allows you to send and receive data on the web
TCP/IP: Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol are communication protocols that define how data should travel across the internet.
DNS: Domain Name System is like an address book for websites.
HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol is an application protocol that defines a language for clients and servers to speak to each other.
Component Files: a website made up of different files, the files come in two main types, Code Files and Assets
                 Code Files: websites built primarily from HTML, CSS, and Javascript
                 Assets:a collective name for all the other stuff that make up a website (images, music, video, Word documents, and PDF's)
                 
"Ever been sitting at home
wondering how could I get that item from the store?
You look down the road and see it peeking back at you
your feet can move you down to get there too.
You make your way out down the road, sending signals to the ground
are you sure you'll make it around?
You see it plain and clear
and as you come up around you notice the rear.
You stop and now its right in your face
that's how HTTP shows up to run the place.
You have made it to the webpage"

HTML, CSS, and JS files are "parsed" in the browser, starting with the HTML file first. As the browser parses the HTML, 
it sends info back to the server for any CSS files found from the <link> elements, and any JavaScript files found from the <script> elements. 
From those, the browser parses CSS and JavaScript. The browser generates an in-memory DOM tree from the parsed HTML, then generates CSSOM structure from
the parsed CSS, and compiles and executes the parsed JS. As the browser builds the DOM and applies the styles from CSSOM, it executes the JS, and a visual 
representation of the page is now on the screen, the user can now interact with it.
  
You find images to add to a website by going to google images and searching for something suitable. Once you find the image you want, click on it to enlarge it. 
Right click the image (Ctrl + click), choose Save Image As and choose the folder to save it in. You can also copy the image's web address 
from the browser address bar.

In JavaScript, a String is created by enclosing it in a single or double quote mark. A Number is created without quotes around them.

Variables are containers that store values. They are necessary to do anything interesting in programming, such as personalize a greeting message, or change an 
image displayed in an image gallery.

  
What is an HTML attribute? An HTML attribute is an element that contains extra information that won't appear in the context.
Describe the Anatomy of an HTMl element. The anatomy of an HTML element is the opening tag, the content, and the closing tag.

What Elements does a “typical” website include? They include headings and paragraphs
How does metadata influence Search Engine Optimization? Using metadata boosts the SEO efforts that are written in the search engine's language. It helps the search engine better understand the topic, and it also helps to display more relevant results.
How is the meta HTML tag used when specifying metadata? The meta tag defines metadata about the HTML document. It is the information about the data.
  
  
What is the first step to designing a Website? The first step to designing a website is deciding what you want to accomplish with it.
What is the most important question to answer when designing a Website? The most important question to answer is "What exactly do I want to accomplish?"
  
Why should you use an h1 element over a span element to display a top level heading? You should use an h1 element over a span because it is a semantic element (adds a large size font to heading), it gives the text its wrapped around a top level heading on the page. Just adding the span element causes it to look like a top level heading, without the styling of adding the h1 element.
What are the benefits of using semantic tags in our HTML? Some of the benefits of using semantic tags are screen readers can use it to help visually impaired users work a page, and search engines will read its contents as vital keywords to push the showing of the search rankings.
  
Describe 2 things that require JavaScript in the Browser? Two things that require JavaScript are adding interactive behavior to web pages, and creating web and mobile apps 
How can you add JavaScript to an HTML document? By employing the dedicated HTML tag script that wraps around JavaScript code.
