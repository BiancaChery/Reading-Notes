## Speed Coding: Building a CRUD API (Watch a Twitch streamer code an Express API in 20 minutes!)

Whatâ€™s the relationship between REST and CRUD? -The relationship between REST and CRUD lies in how RESTful APIs structure their endpoints and map HTTP methods to CRUD operations.

If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be? 
1. Define your resources and endpoints.
2. Choose HTTP methods for CRUD operations.
3. Design the data model and schema.
4. Implement API endpoints and logic.
5. Test, document and deploy.
