## API Design Best Practices

What does REST stand for? -Representational State Transfer, which is an architectural approach to designing web services. 

REST APIs are designed around a "resource".

What is an identifier of a resource? Give an example. -An identifier of a resource is a URI. An example is: "https://adventure-works.com/orders/1".

What are the most common HTTP verbs? -The most common verbs are: "GET", "POST", "PUT", "PATCH", and "DELETE".

What should the URIs be based on? -

Give an example of a good URI. A good URI could be: 
"{
    "orderID":3,
    "productID":2,
    "quantity":4,
    "orderValue":16.60,
    "links": [
        {"rel":"product","href":"https://adventure-works.com/customers/3", "action":"GET" },
        {"rel":"product","href":"https://adventure-works.com/customers/3", "action":"PUT" }
    ]
}"
