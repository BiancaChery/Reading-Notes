# React Docs - Forms

What is a ‘Controlled Component’? -A 'controlled component' is an input form element, 
that when combined with the React state, renders a form that is then controlled by React.

Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the 
state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why. -It would need to be updated as soon as it is entered. The state is kept in sync with the input’s value, meaning 
that changing the input will update the state, and updating the state will change the input.

How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field? -We would use a handle function with setState to add the event handler on.

## The Conditional (Ternary) Operator Explained

Why would we use a ternary operator? -To test an age, and test it in one line.

Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement: 'x===y ? true : false'
if(x===y){
  console.log(true);
} else {
  console.log(false);
}
