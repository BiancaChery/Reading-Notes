# What is OAuth

What is OAuth? -An open-standard authorization protocol or framework that describes how unrelated servers and services can safely allow authenticated access to their assets without actually sharing the initial, related, single logon credential

Give an example of what using OAuth would look like. -When you go to log onto a website and it offers one or more opportunities to log on using another website’s/service’s logon. You then click on the button linked to the other website, the other website authenticates you, and the website you were originally connecting to logs you on itself afterward using permission gained from the second website.

How does OAuth work? What are the steps that it takes to authenticate the user? -A user has already signed into one website or service (OAuth only works using HTTPS). The user then initiates a feature/transaction that needs to access another unrelated site or service. The following happens (greatly simplified):
-The first website connects to the second website on behalf of the user, using OAuth, providing the user’s verified identity.
-The second site generates a one-time token and a one-time secret unique to the transaction and parties involved.
-The first site gives this token and secret to the initiating user’s client software.
-The client’s software presents the request token and secret to their authorization provider (which may or may not be the second site).
-If not already authenticated to the authorization provider, the client may be asked to authenticate. After authentication, the client is asked to approve the authorization transaction to the second website.
-The user approves (or their software silently approves) a particular transaction type at the first website.
-The user is given an approved access token (notice it’s no longer a request token).
-The user gives the approved access token to the first website.
-The first website gives the access token to the second website as proof of authentication on behalf of the user.
-The second website lets the first website access their site on behalf of the user.
-The user sees a successfully completed transaction occurring.

What is OpenID? -An open standard and decentralized authentication protocol that allows users to log in to various websites and applications using a single set of credentials.

# Authorization and Authentication flows

What is the difference between authorization and authentication? -Authorization is the process of determining whether an authenticated user has the necessary permissions to access a specific resource or perform a certain action. Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, system, or entity.

What is Authorization Code Flow? -An authentication flow that provides a secure method for obtaining an access token, which is used to access protected resources on behalf of a user. 

What is Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)? -An enhanced security version of the standard ACF, it provides an extra layer of security to prevent certain attacks. 

What is Implicit Flow with Form Post? -An authorization flow used for client-side applications to obtain access tokens. 

What is Client Credentials Flow? -An authorization flow primarily used for server-to-server communication, where a client requests access tokens directly from an authorization srver, without involving a user.

What is Device Authorization Flow? -An authorization flow designed to provide a method for devices with limited input capabilities to obtain access tokens. 

What is Resource Owner Password Flow? -An authorization that requests that users provide credentials, typically using an interactive form.
