This topic relates to what we're learning, as it explains different object basics and explains what the DOM method is in JavaScript. We need to know these things to help better understand the different parts of the JS language.

**JavaScript Object Basics

How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with? An object is related to JavaScript (the coding within a website), it is a collection of data and/or functionality. They have variables and functions (types of codes) in them to help make up the website.

What are some advantages to creating object literals? The advantages of creating object literals are the convenience, the flexibility in declaration and less code during declaration. You can add an object literal anywhere in your program and it will work.

How do objects differ from arrays? Objects represent a special data type that is mutable and can be used to store a collection of datat. Whereas, arrays are also mutable but they can be used to store a list of values.

Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an objectâ€™s property instead of dot notation. -You would use bracket notation if an object property name is held in a variable

Evaluate the code below. What does the term this refer to and what is the advantage to using this? It refers to an object property, and it is used to acces the value in the notation.


**Introduction To The DOM

What is the DOM? The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for web documents. It is in place for the whole page, programs can change the document structure, style and the content of the program.

Briefly describe the relationship between the DOM and JavaScript. -The DOM is not part of the JavaScript language, but without it, the JS language wouldn't have any model or notion of web pages, HTML documents, SVG documents, and the component parts to these documents.
